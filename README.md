# Ecommerce-Python-Django-CoffeeShop

This is my tutorial project for an online store with django. The project is still under development. 
It has already implemented such functionality as: adding goods to the cart, order confirmation, authentication, user account. 
The API of the local delivery service is connected to the "delivery" form. 
API provides a list of cities in which the company operates and a list of post offices in these cities.
